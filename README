HOMELAB

This repository contains the configuration for my homelab.

- Machine are running NixOS.
- Services are hosted in Kubernetes.
- Secrets are managed with SOPS and AGE keys.

PREREQUISITES

- Your machine AGE key for SOPS is valid recipient in .sops.yaml.
- Network where the IP range 192.168.1.10 - 192.168.1.29 is free (not used by DHCP).
- Gateway and DNS is available at IP 192.168.1.1

NEW MACHINE

1. Build a bootable NixOS ISO image.
2. Boot machine from built ISO.
3. Get the IP address of the new machine.
4. Install NixOS from flake using `make machine-connected-install` or `make machine-remote-install`.
5. Run the `make machine-post-install` to commit the newly generated
   `hardware-configuration.nix` to the repository.

ISSUES

- K3S token rotation: Changing token requires resetting the cluster 
  GitHub issue: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/308201
  Cluster upkeep docs: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/networking/cluster/k3s/docs/CLUSTER_UPKEEP.md
- When using sops in NixOS (sops-nix) the 'dotenv' format is written
  "wholefile" as each key on the host in /run/secret, so not working very well.

ISSUE CERTIFICATES
1. Create Root CA: `openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/root-ca-homelab.key -out certs/root-ca-homelab.crt`
    Follow the instructions in the output to create a new root CA.
2. Create service certificate: `openssl genrsa -out certs/service-homelab.key 2048`
3. Create certificate signing request: `openssl req -key certs/service-homelab.key -new -out certs/service-homelab.csr`
   Common Name (CN) should be the FQDN of the service, challange can be left empty.
4. Create extension file `certs/service-homelab.ext` to add SANs:
   ```
   authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
   basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
   keyUsage=digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
   extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth,clientAuth
   subjectAltName=@alt_names
   [alt_names]
   DNS.1 = homelab,
   DNS.2 = *.homelab
   ```
5. Sing the cerificate with our `root-ca-homelab.crt`:
   `openssl x509 -req -CA certs/root-ca-homelab.crt -CAkey certs/root-ca-homelab.key -in certs/service-homelab.csr -out certs/service-homelab.crt -days 365 -CAcreateserial -extfile certs/service-homelab.ext`
